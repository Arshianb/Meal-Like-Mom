# Goal
:boom: Find the food that fits your materials as quickly as possible

## How?
Recipes for different foods in general categories (dinner:pizza:, lunch:poultry_leg:, breakfast:egg:, dessert:tropical_drink:, and appetizers:fries:) and finer categories, including food ingredients, help the user find the food he likes faster and easier :mag_right:. It can also be a good source of funding for skilled chefs to become famous with the videos they share in the program :star:, or to get an order :raised_hand:, or even to price their cooking videos :exclamation:.

# About The Project
After the user Sign up to the app for the first time, his phone id saved in the database, and the next time after the program was deleted, he enters the program only with a username because his phone id remains in DB. If the user's phone is offline, the phone's own internal database will be used for better performance. Database tables are interconnected with the help of ID for accurate classification of cooking videos. `Android Studio` source codes are in the **master branch**.
